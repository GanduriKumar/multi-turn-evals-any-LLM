## Basis of coverage (what we combine)

We build coverage by combining business areas (domains) with customer behaviors. These tables are the basis of coverage.

### Domains (business areas)

| Domain | Short description |
| --- | --- |
| Product Discovery & Search | Finding products using search, filters, categories, and suggestions. |
| Product Details & Content | The product page: title, images, specs, reviews, and availability info. |
| Recommendations & Ranking | What items are suggested and in what order across pages and widgets. |
| Pricing, Offers & Promotions | Prices, discounts, coupons, bundles, and how deals are shown. |
| Cart Management | Adding/removing items, changing quantities, showing savings, cart rules. |
| Checkout & Payments | Address entry, shipping options, taxes, payment methods, confirmation. |
| Order Management | Viewing status, changing/canceling orders, reorders, invoices. |
| Shipping & Delivery | Delivery promises, dates, fees, pickup options, tracking updates. |
| Returns, Refunds & Exchanges | Policies and flows to return/exchange items and get refunds. |
| Customer Support & Escalations | Help content, chat/phone support, and handoff to human agents. |
| User Account & Preferences | Profiles, saved addresses/payments, wishlists, alerts, privacy settings. |
| Trust, Safety & Fraud | Identity checks, fraud prevention, abuse controls, policy enforcement. |
| Merchant / Seller Operations | Seller onboarding, catalog tools, inventory, pricing, order handling. |
| System Awareness & Failure Handling | Outages, errors, fallbacks, and clear messaging during issues. |

### Behaviors (how customers ask)

| Behavior | Short description |
| --- | --- |
| Happy Path | Simple, straightforward request that should just work. |
| Constraint-heavy Queries | Requests with many limits (price cap, brand, delivery date). |
| Ambiguous Queries | Vague ask that needs clarification to proceed. |
| Multi-turn Conversations | Back-and-forth dialog to gather details and converge on a solution. |
| User Corrections | Customer changes or corrects earlier information mid-conversation. |
| Adversarial/Trap Queries | Attempts to break rules, trick the system, or push policy limits. |

# Why we have ~606 tests today, and a smarter plan (plain English)

In 60 seconds
- Today: We create ~600 test conversations per business area. That’s thorough but slow and costly.
- Why so many: We try almost every combination of four “dials” (explained below) across six customer behaviors.
- Better plan: Test fewer, smarter examples that still cover the important ground. Keep critical and risky cases.
- Result: 70–85% fewer tests, similar confidence, faster feedback, lower cost.

1) What creates the ~606 tests? The “dials” and behaviors
- The 4 dials (factors):
   - Price sensitivity (low / medium / high)
      - Commerce link: How sensitive the shopper is to price. Affects promotions, discounts, substitutions.
   - Brand bias (none / soft / hard)
      - Commerce link: Preference for a brand. Influences recommendations and acceptable alternatives.
   - Availability (in‑stock / low‑stock / backorder / out‑of‑stock)
      - Commerce link: Whether the item can ship now. Drives delivery promises and substitutions.
   - Policy boundary (within‑policy / near‑limit / out‑of‑policy)
      - Commerce link: Business rules (returns, fraud checks, age limits). Determines what is allowed.

- The 6 behavior types (how customers ask):
   - Happy Path: Straightforward request.
   - Constraint‑heavy: Lots of conditions (price cap, timing, brand).
   - Ambiguous: Vague or unclear ask.
   - Multi‑turn: Needs back‑and‑forth clarification.
   - Corrections: Customer changes their mind.
   - Adversarial/Trap: Tries to break rules or trick the system.

- Why ~606 per domain?
   - Raw combinations per behavior = 3×3×4×3 = 108 (from the 4 dials above).
   - Across 6 behaviors → 6×108 = 648.
   - We remove a few impossible/irrelevant cases (e.g., Happy Path forbids out‑of‑policy), landing around 606 per business area (domain). Some domains may vary a bit.

2) How we optimize (fewer tests) without losing meaningful coverage
- Pairwise coverage (the big win)
   - Idea: Make sure every pair of dials and their values appears at least once somewhere, instead of testing every 4‑way combo.
   - Why this works: Most real problems appear when two things interact (e.g., “out‑of‑stock” AND “near policy limit”). Testing each pair catches the majority of issues with far fewer tests.
   - Simple analogy: Car testing—don’t drive every possible road+weather+tire+fuel combo. Ensure each pair shows up (rain+snow tires, highway+diesel, etc.). You still find key issues.

- Keep the risky stuff heavy
   - We keep more tests where mistakes are costly or likely: policy edges, out‑of‑stock, high price sensitivity.
   - We keep fewer in the “routine” zone (in‑stock and within policy).

- Always‑on anchors (must‑pass set)
   - A small list of non‑negotiable scenarios per domain that we always run. Protects against regressions we already know about.

- Dial‑up where needed
   - For sensitive areas (e.g., safety/fraud), we can use 3‑way coverage on demand while staying lean elsewhere.

- Keep the same guardrails
   - We still block impossible or irrelevant cases. Business rules remain intact.

- Predictable budgets
   - Set simple caps like “≤100 tests per domain” or “≤20 per behavior.” We fit inside these budgets while meeting pairwise coverage and risk priorities.

- Why this doesn’t lose the coverage that matters
   - Guarantees: Every pair of dial values is still tested.
   - Focus: Risky/policy‑sensitive cases stay in.
   - Safety net: Anchors always run; sensitive areas can use 3‑way.
   - Oversight: We monitor results; if we see misses, we dial up locally.

3) What leaders should expect
- Today: ~600 tests/domain → New: ~90–120 tests/domain (pairwise + anchors + risky cases).
- Benefits: 70–85% fewer tests, much faster runs, much lower cost, more frequent testing.
- Confidence: Similar defect‑finding power because we still test all important interactions and keep high‑risk cases.

Clear next steps (simple)
- Pick budgets (e.g., ≤100 per domain) and list 5–10 anchors/domain.
- Mark high‑risk domains/behaviors that get optional 3‑way coverage.
- Pilot on 2–3 domains; compare time/cost and issues found. Roll out if results hold.

Executive talking points
- We’re replacing brute‑force with smart coverage.
- We cover the interactions that actually surface problems.
- Risky and policy‑sensitive cases remain protected.
- We spend less, move faster, and keep the same confidence.
